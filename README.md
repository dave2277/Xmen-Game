# Xmen-Game

The Xmen-Game is an application designed to demonstrate understanding of DOM object manipulation and logical functions using jQuery.  

The game mimics a rudimentary RPG in which the user can:
1.  Select a character
2.  Choose an opponent
3.  Attack the opponent until either the user or opponent is defeated, and if victorious
4.  Attack the remaining opponents until the user is either victorious or defeated

Your character will multiply attack power with each successive attack.
Your opponent has a static counter attack power.
There are only certain paths to defeating all the opponents, so the user must be strategic in their selections.

Access to the application is via the git hub page:
